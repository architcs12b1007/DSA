// If removing a vertex and its related edges causes the graph to become disconnected, the vertex is considered to be an articulation point in the graph. Therefore, the number of related connected components in a graph grows as articulation points are removed.

// Sometimes articulation points are referred to as CUT VERTUCES

// Given undirected graph, find all articulation points
// eg: 0-1-2-3-4  o/p: 1,2 and 3 are articulation points

// Approach 1 : Brute Force : To remove all vertices one by one and see if it causes the graph to become disconnected using DFS.Time : O(V *(E + V))

// Approach 2:

int main()
{

    return 0;
}
